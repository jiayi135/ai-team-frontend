Hugging Face Space Build Error
================================

Space: HuFelix135/ai-team-frontend
URL: https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuFelix135/ai-team-frontend

Error: Job failed with exit code: 1

Reason: cache miss errors during Docker build

Steps that failed:
- [2/7] WORKDIR /app - cache miss
- [3/7] RUN npm install -g pnpm - cache miss
- [4/7] COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./ - cache miss
- [5/7] RUN pnpm install - cache miss
- [6/7] COPY . . - cache miss
- [7/7] RUN pnpm run build - cache miss

Analysis:
The build is failing at the "pnpm run build" step. This could be due to:
1. Missing build scripts in package.json
2. TypeScript compilation errors
3. Missing dependencies
4. Build configuration issues

Next steps:
1. Check package.json for build scripts
2. Verify Dockerfile configuration
3. Test build locally
4. Fix any TypeScript errors
5. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
